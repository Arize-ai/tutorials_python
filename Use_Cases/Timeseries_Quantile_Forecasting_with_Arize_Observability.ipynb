    "# Timeseries Observability in Arize with Quantile Forecasts\n",
    "Timeseries Forecasting models often produce quantile and/or upper and lower range predictions as well as midpoint predictions. This guide provides recommendations for the ideal format for uploading quantile and range forecast data to Arize, and covers how to calculate specific time series evaluation metrics such as Pinball Loss in Arize.\n",
    " \n",
    "In Timeseries Forecasting, it is is common to forecast upper and lower bounds as well as forecasting the midpoint prediction value.\n",
    " \n",
    "This example model is predicting 30 day revenue forecasts with upper and lower quantile ranges. The model produces a midpoint prediction, as well as upper and lower quantile range predictions. The model produces:\n",
    "* 75% quantile forecast values.\n",
    "* midpoint forecast values.\n",
    "* 25% quantile forecast values.\n",
    " \n",
    "This tutorial will step through formating the timeseries data and sending it to Arize. And then configuring MAE, MAPE, and Pinball Loss metrics using both the midpoint forecasts and the quartile forecasts in Arize.\n",
