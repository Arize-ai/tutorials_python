One such reason could be an issue with the formatting of your data in a particular row or column of the file. In order to make sure that all your files are successfully uploaded, you may wish to query an import job that you've created for any failed files. If they exist, the file path and a helpful error message are provided for you, and you can rememdy the issue by fixing the error and rename the file to trigger a re-read."
