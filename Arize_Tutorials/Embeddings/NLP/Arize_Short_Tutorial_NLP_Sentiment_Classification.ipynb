    "In this scenario, you are in charge of maintaining a sentiment classification model. This simple model takes online reviews of your U.S.-based product as the input and predict whether the reviewer's sentiment was positive, negative, or neutral. You trained your sentiment classification model on English reviews. However, once the model was released into production, you notice that the performance of the model has degraded over a period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arize is able to surface the reason for this performance degradation. In this example, the presence of reviews written in Spanish impact the model's performance. You can surface and troubleshoot this issue by analyzing the _embedding vectors_ associated with the online review text.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that, according to our research, inspecting embedding drift can surface problems with your data before they cause performance degradation.\n",
