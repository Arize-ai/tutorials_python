    "**In this walkthrough, we are going to ingest embedding data and look at embedding drift.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, you are in charge of maintaining a sentiment classification model. This simple model takes online reviews of your U.S.-based product as the input and predict whether the reviewer's sentiment was positive, negative, or neutral. You trained your sentiment classification model on English reviews. However, once the model was released into production, you notice that the performance of the model has degraded over a period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arize is able to surface the reason for this performance degradation. In this example, the presence of reviews written in Spanish impact the model's performance. You can surface and troubleshoot this issue by analyzing the _embedding vectors_ associated with the online review text.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that, according to our research, inspecting embedding drift can surface problems with your data before they cause performance degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will start from scratch. We will:\n",
    "* Download the data\n",
    "* Preprocess the data\n",
    "* Train the model\n",
    "* Extract embedding vectors and predictions\n",
    "* Log the inferences into the Arize Platform\n",
    "* Visually explore embeddings in the Arize Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using [ü§ó Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)'s open source libraries to make this process extremely easy. In particular, we will use:\n",
    "* [ü§ó Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index): a library used for easily accessing and sharing datasets, and evaluation metrics for Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer vision, and audio tasks.\n",
    "* [ü§ó Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index): a library used to easily download and use state-of-the-art pre-trained models. Using pre-trained models can lower your compute costs, reduce your carbon footprint, and save you time from training a model from scratch.\n",
