    "In this scenario, you are in charge of maintaining a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model. This simple model can automatically scan text, pull out some fundamental entities within it, and classify them into predefined categories: Person, Location, or Organization. However, once the model was released into production, you notice that the performance of the model has degraded over a period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arize is able to surface the reason for this performance degradation. In this example, text including locations is under-represented in the training set. This label imbalance impacts the model's performance. You can surface and troubleshoot this issue by analyzing the _embedding vectors_ associated with the input text.\n",

When the drift distance is high, the tag proportions in our production set are different to those of the baseline.

This is specifically useful to detect drift by locating the areas where there are production data-points present but not (or not as many) baseline data-points. This gives an indication of severe dataset drift. We can identify exactly what datapoints our baseline is missing so that re-train effectively.\n",
    "2. By Prediction Label: This coloring option gives an insight on how is our model making decisions. Where are the different classes located in the space? Is the model predicting one class in regions where it should be predicting another?\n",
    "3. By Actual Label: This coloring option is great if we want to identify labeling issues. For instance, if inside the orange cloud, we can see a points of other colors, it is a good idea to check and see if the labels are wrong. Further we can use the corrected labels for re-training. This separation is specially difficult when clusters are joined, since both the model and UMAP have trouble separating the data-points.\n",
    "4. By Correctness: This coloring option offers a quick way of identifying where the bulk of your model's mistakes are placed, giving you an area to pay attention to. In this example, we can see that the spanish reviews are almost all red.\n",
    "5. By Confusion Matrix: This coloring option allows you to select a `positive class` and color the data-points as `True Positives`, `True Negatives`, `False Positives`, `False Negatives`.\n",
    "6. By Feature: You can identify areas of the space where your model might be underperforming and, by coloring the points by feature, identify patterns at feature level. In other words, you can identify a slice of your data sharing a common feature (or features) that are causing a problem.\n",
    "7. By Prediction Score: You can identify areas where your model is more confident of its predictions and areas where your model struggled more to make a decision.\n",
