    "In this scenario, you are in charge of maintaining a sentiment classification model. This simple model takes online reviews of your U.S.-based product as the input and predict whether the reviewer's sentiment was positive, negative, or neutral. You trained your sentiment classification model on English reviews. However, once the model was released into production, you notice that the performance of the model has degraded over a period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arize is able to surface the reason for this performance degradation. In this example, the presence of reviews written in Spanish impact the model's performance. You can surface and troubleshoot this issue by analyzing the _embedding vectors_ associated with the online review text.\n",

    "In the display above, Arize offers many coloring options:\n",
    "1. By Dataset: You can see that the coloring has been made to distinguish production data vs baseline data (training in this example). This is specifically useful to detect drift. In this example, we can see that there is some production data far away from any training data, giving an indication of severe dataset drift. We can identify exactly what datapoints our baseline is missing so that re-train effectively.\n",
    "2. By Prediction Label: This coloring option gives an insight on how is our model making decisions. Where are the different classes located in the space? Is the model predicting one class in regions where it should be predicting another?\n",
    "3. By Actual Label: This coloring option is great if we want to identify labeling issues. For instance, if inside the orange cloud, we can see points of other colors, it is a good idea to check and see if the labels are wrong. Further we can use the corrected labels for re-training.\n",
    "4. By Correctness: This coloring option offers a quick way of identifying where the bulk of your model's mistakes are placed, giving you an area to pay attention to. In this example, we can see that the spanish reviews are almost all red.\n",
    "5. By Confusion Matrix: This coloring option allows you to select a `positive class` and color the data-points as `True Positives`, `True Negatives`, `False Positives`, `False Negatives`.\n",
    "6. By Feature: You can identify areas of the space where your model might be underperforming and, by coloring the points by feature, identify patterns at feature level. In other words, you can identify a slice of your data sharing a common feature (or features) that are causing a problem.\n",
    "7. By Prediction Score: You can identify areas where your model is more confident of its predictions and areas where your model struggled more to make a decision.\n",

    "More coloring options will be added to help you understand and debug your model and dataset."
