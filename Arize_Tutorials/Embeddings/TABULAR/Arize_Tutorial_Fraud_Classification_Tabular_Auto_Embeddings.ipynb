    "You are responsible for a credit card fraud model at a large bank or payment processing company. You have been alerted by a spike in credit card chargebacks leading you to suspect that fraudsters are getting away with commiting fraud undetected! Realizing that this flaw in your model's performance has a heavy cost on your company and customers, you understand the need for a powerful toolset to troubleshoot (and prevent) costly model degradations. You turn to Arize to find out what changed in your credit card fraud detection model and how you can improve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this walkthrough, we are going to investigate your production credit card fraud model. We will validate degradation in model performance, troubleshoot the root cause, and furthermore set up proactive monitors to mitigate the impact of future degradations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will set up monitors to proactively identify when our fraud model is not perfoming as expected, troubleshoot why we're seeing this deviation in production, and come up with actionable steps to improve the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our steps to resolving this issue will be:\n",
    "1. Get our model onto the Arize platform to investigate\n",
    "2. Setup a performance dashboard to look at prediction performance\n",
    "3. Understand where the model is underperforming\n",
    "4. Discover the root cause of why a slice (grouping) of predictions is underperforming\n",
    "5. Set up pro-active monitoring to mitigate the impact of such degradations in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "The production data contains 1 month of data where 2 main issues exist. You will work on identifying these issues over the course of this exercise.\n",

    "2. The model is missing fraud for certain merchant types,entry modes and merchant ids especially in certain regions.\n",

    " Click on the Embedding Name or the Euclidean Distance value to see how your embedding data is drifting over time. In the picture below we represent the global euclidean distance between your production set (at different points in time) and the baseline (which we set to be our training set). We can see there is a period of a week where suddenly the distance is remarkably higher. This shows us that during that time text data was sent to our model that was different than what it was trained on (English). This is the period of time when reviews written in Spanish were sent alongside the expected English reviews.\n",

    "In addition to the drift tracking plot above, below you can find the UMAP visualization of your data, according to the point in time selected. Notice that the production data and our baseline (training) data are superimposed, which is indicative that the model is seeing data in production similar to the data it was trained on.\n",

    "Next, select a point in time when the drift was high and select a UMAP visualization in 2D. We can see that both training and production data are superimposed for the most part, but another cluster of production data has appeared. This indicates that the model is seeing data in production qualitatively different to the data it was trained on, and in this case causing performance degradation.\n",

    "In the display above, Arize offers many coloring options:\n",
    "1. By Dataset: You can see that the coloring has been made to distinguish production data vs baseline data (training in this example). This is specifically useful to detect drift. In this example, we can see that there is some production data far away from any training data, giving an indication of severe dataset drift. We can identify exactly what datapoints our baseline is missing so that re-train effectively.\n",
    "2. By Prediction Label: This coloring option gives an insight on how is our model making decisions. Where are the different classes located in the space? Is the model predicting one class in regions where it should be predicting another?\n",
    "3. By Actual Label: This coloring option is great if we want to identify labeling issues. For instance, if inside the orange cloud, we can see points of other colors, it is a good idea to check and see if the labels are wrong. Further we can use the corrected labels for re-training.\n",
    "4. By Correctness: This coloring option offers a quick way of identifying where the bulk of your model's mistakes are placed, giving you an area to pay attention to. In this example, we can see that the spanish reviews are almost all red.\n",
    "5. By Confusion Matrix: This coloring option allows you to select a `positive class` and color the data-points as `True Positives`, `True Negatives`, `False Positives`, `False Negatives`.\n",
    "6. By Feature: You can identify areas of the space where your model might be underperforming and, by coloring the points by feature, identify patterns at feature level. In other words, you can identify a slice of your data sharing a common feature (or features) that are causing a problem.\n",
    "7. By Prediction Score: You can identify areas where your model is more confident of its predictions and areas where your model struggled more to make a decision.\n",
