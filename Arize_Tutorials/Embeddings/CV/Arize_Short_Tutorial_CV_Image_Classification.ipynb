In this example, there are worse quality images in the production set during some period of time.\n",

For instance, if inside the orange cloud, we can see a points of other colors, it is a good idea to check and see if the labels are wrong. Further we can use the corrected labels for re-training. This separation is specially difficult when clusters are joined, since both the model and UMAP have trouble separating the data-points.\n",

In this example, we can see the difference between the red and blue images and almost all the red images have significantly worse quality (e.g. they are rotated and blurred).\n",
        "5. By Confusion Matrix: This coloring option allows you to select a `positive class` and color the data-points as `True Positives`, `True Negatives`, `False Positives`, `False Negatives`.\n",
        "6. By Feature: You can identify areas of the space where your model might be underperforming and, by coloring the points by feature, identify patterns at feature level. In other words, you can identify a slice of your data sharing a common feature (or features) that are causing a problem.\n",
