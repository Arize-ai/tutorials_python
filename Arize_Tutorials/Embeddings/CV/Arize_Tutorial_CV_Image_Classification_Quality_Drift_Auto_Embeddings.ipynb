    "In this scenario, you are in charge of maintaining an Image Classification model. Your model, resnet-50, will classify the input images into the 10 predefined categories of the Fashion MNIST (see [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/arize-ai/fashion_mnist_quality_drift)). However, once the model is released into production, you notice that the performance of the model has degraded over a period of time.\n",

    "This notebook will show you how Arize can automatically surface and troubleshoot the reason for this performance degradation by analyzing _image vectors_ associated with the input images so that you can take the right action to retrain your model/clean your data, saving you time and effort to correctly wrangle the datasets and visualize them. In this example, there are worse quality images in the production set during some period of time.\n",

    "In the display above, Arize offers many coloring options:\n",
    "1. By Dataset: You can see that the coloring has been made to distinguish production data vs baseline data (training in this example). This is specifically useful to detect drift. In this example, we can see that there is some production data far away from any training data, giving an indication of severe dataset drift. We can identify exactly what datapoints our baseline is missing so that we can re-train effectively.\n",
    "2. By Prediction Label: This coloring option gives an insight on how is our model making decisions. Where are the different classes located in the space? Is the model predicting one class in regions where it should be predicting another?\n",
    "3. By Actual Label: This coloring option is great if we want to identify labeling issues. For instance, if inside the orange cloud, we can see a points of other colors, it is a good idea to check and see if the labels are wrong. Further we can use the corrected labels for re-training. This separation is specially difficult when clusters are joined, since both the model and UMAP have trouble separating the data-points.\n",
    "4. By Correctness: This coloring option offers a quick way of identifying where the bulk of your model's mistakes are placed, giving you an area to pay attention to. In this example, we can see the difference between the red and blue images and almost all the red images have significantly worse quality (e.g. they are rotated and blurred).\n",
    "5. By Confusion Matrix: This coloring option allows you to select a `positive class` and color the data-points as `True Positives`, `True Negatives`, `False Positives`, `False Negatives`.\n",
    "6. By Feature: You can identify areas of the space where your model might be underperforming and, by coloring the points by feature, identify patterns at feature level. In other words, you can identify a slice of your data sharing a common feature (or features) that are causing a problem.\n",
    "7. By Prediction Score: You can identify areas where your model is more confident of its predictions and areas where your model struggled more to make a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "More coloring options will be added to help you understand and debug your model and dataset."
