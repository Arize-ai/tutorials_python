    "In this scenario, you are in charge of maintaining an Object Detection model. Your model, [Facebook DETR](https://huggingface.co/facebook/detr-resnet-101), will localize and classify entities in input images from the [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home). However, once the model is released into production, you notice that the performance of the model has degraded over a period of time.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how Arize can automatically surface and troubleshoot the reason for this performance degradation by analyzing _image vectors_ associated with the input image so that you can take the right action to retrain your model/clean your data, saving you time and effort to correctly wrangle the datasets and visualize them. In this example, there are worse quality images in the production set during some period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that, according to our research, inspecting embedding drift can surface problems with your data before they cause performance degradation.\n",
